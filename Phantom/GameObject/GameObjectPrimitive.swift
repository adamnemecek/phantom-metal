	/// Creates a primitive gameobject in the shape of a rectangular box or cube.

	/// - Parameters:
	///   - dimensions: A vector containing the width (x-component), height (y-component), and depth (z-component) of the box to generate. If all components are equal, this method generates a cube.
	///   - segments: The number of points to generate along each dimension. A larger number of points increases rendering fidelity but decreases rendering performance.
	///   - geometryType: The type of geometric primitive from which to construct the mesh; must be either kindTriangles, kindQuads, or lines.
	///   - inwardNormals: true to generate normal vectors pointing toward the inside of the box; false to generate normal vectors pointing outward.
	/// - Returns: A new GameObject with MeshRenderer component.

	/// - Parameters:
	///   - radius: A vector containing the width (x-component), height (y-component), and depth (z-component) of the bounding box of the ellipsoid to generate. If all components are equal, this method generates a sphere.
	///   - radialSegments: The number of points to generate around the horizontal circumference of the ellipsoid (that is, its cross-section in the xz-plane). A larger number of points increases rendering fidelity but decreases rendering performance.
	///   - verticalSegments: The number of points to generate along the height of the ellipsoid. A larger number of points increases rendering fidelity but decreases rendering performance.
	///   - geometryType: The type of geometric primitive from which to construct the mesh; must be either kindTriangles or kindQuads.
	///   - inwardNormals: true to generate normal vectors pointing toward the center of the ellipsoid; false to generate normal vectors pointing outward.
	///   - hemisphere: true to generate only the upper half of the ellipsoid or sphere (a dome); false to generate a complete ellipsoid or sphere.
	/// - Returns: A new GameObject with MeshRenderer component.
